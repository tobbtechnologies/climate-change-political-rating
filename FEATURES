The app should have the following broad structures:

1. Authentication 
  - Social media
  - or register with username, password, email - new user should verify account via email
2. Search for Politicical Figures on search bar or from Directory listing of all countries
  - if the Political Figure does not exist user can add the person and profile image
  - added data must not be public until verified by admin
3. Ratings
  - rate the person out of 5, no user data input should be allowed 
4. All people should be able to view a graph showing ratings per country, region, town, city etc
5. Back End 
  - Admin login 
  - settings
  - moderation of added persons
  
  
  Ionic Framework should be used to develop this app. Anyone anywhere is free to contribute.
